# Chat AI Assistant Project

## Overview
This project aims to create a chat AI assistant using the Gemini API. It leverages ChatGPT for natural language processing and interaction.

## Project Structure

### Files and Folders

- **index.html**: Login page and main entry point.
- **sample.html**: Main page of the chat assistant.
- **logout.html**: Logout functionality.
- **test/**: Folder containing HTML files for testing Gemini API functionality.
- **public/**: Folder for SVG and image files used in the project.

### CSS Files

- **global.css**: Global styles for the entire project.
- **index.css**: Styles specific to the index.html (login) page.

### Development Process

1. **Design Phase**:
   - Designed the user interface in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/design/ckXsPtnASv488puJfB8o9g/chat-ai-assistant?node-id=0-1&t=ECcJhDOXZMKwHwIG-1).
   - Converted Figma design to HTML and CSS.

2. **Implementation**:
   - Implemented login functionality (`index.html`) with date saved in local storage.
   - Developed main chat interface (`sample.html`) using Gemini API and ChatGPT.
   - Added logout functionality (`logout.html`).

3. **Testing**:
   - Created test cases in the `test/` folder to validate Gemini API integration.
   - Ensured functionality and responsiveness across browsers and devices.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Deployed the application for testing and feedback.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript
  - Gemini API integration for chat functionality
  - SVG and image assets in `public/` folder

- **Design Tools**:
  - Figma for initial UI/UX design

### Challenges and Solutions

- **Integration of ChatGPT**:
  - Customizing responses and handling user prompts effectively.

- **Gemini API Integration**:
  - Ensuring smooth communication between frontend and API endpoints.

- **Non-Responsive Design**:
  - Acknowledgment that the design is not responsive, may contain errors, particularly in login pages.

- **Local Storage Usage**:
  - Login date saved in local storage for inspection.

### Project Outcome

The outcome of this project was to become familiar with front-end designing techniques and API handling, particularly integrating the Gemini API with ChatGPT for interactive chat functionality.

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates the integration of ChatGPT and the Gemini API to build a responsive and interactive chat AI assistant. Despite potential errors and non-responsive design, it showcases functionalities implemented using modern web technologies.
